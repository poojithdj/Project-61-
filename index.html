        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My inspiration is my Dad because he is really hardworking and intelligent. He is there whenever I need him. He has taken care of me for over a decade, without him I would not be able to go to school or I wound not be able to do coding also. He is also helping me make my dreams come true so slowly I am able to achieve my dreams. He is the best and I want to be intelligent and hardworking like him. That is why he is my inspiration.
